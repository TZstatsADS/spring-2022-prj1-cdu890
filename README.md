### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Project title: Consistency of Emotions Within Philosophy Schools
+ This project is conducted by Christie Du (cd3250)

+ Project summary: While we might think of philosophy readings as more emotionless than other texts, it is interesting to observe the sentiments being expressed in different schools of philosophical texts. More specifically, we can ask: do texts under the same school share similar emotions? Are certain schools more likely to share emotions across writings? Using sentiment analysis and clustering, we observed that German Idealism, Analytic, and Nietzsche are the schools with the most consistent emotions across different texts while Communism and Feminism were the least consistent in emotions.
